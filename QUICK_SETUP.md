# 🚀 Quick Setup: Use Your Instagram Access Token

## ✅ What's Ready

Your Instagram grid component is now configured to use your real Instagram data! Here's what you need to do:

## 🔧 Step 1: Update Configuration

Edit the file `src/config/instagram.js` and replace these values:

```javascript
export const INSTAGRAM_CONFIG = {
  // 🔑 Replace with your actual Instagram Access Token
  ACCESS_TOKEN: 'your_actual_access_token_here',
  
  // 👤 Replace with your Instagram User ID
  USER_ID: 'your_actual_user_id_here',
  
  // ... rest stays the same
};
```

## 📋 Step 2: Get Your Instagram User ID

If you don't have your User ID, you can get it by:

1. **Using your access token:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://graph.instagram.com/me?fields=id,username&access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Or visit:** `https://www.instagram.com/YOUR_USERNAME/?__a=1`
   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Instagram username)

## 🧪 Step 3: Test Your Connection

1. Save the config file
2. Restart your development server
3. Go to your Instagram grid page
4. Click the **"🔧 Test Instagram API Connection"** button
5. Check the status message

## 🎯 Expected Results

- ✅ **Success**: You'll see your real Instagram posts with actual likes, comments, and captions
- ❌ **Error**: Check the error message and refer to `INSTAGRAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting

## 🔄 What Happens Next

Once configured:
- Your real Instagram posts will appear in the grid
- Click any post to see the 3D rendering
- The component will automatically fetch new posts from your account
- If the API fails, it falls back to mock data

## 📚 Need Help?

- Check `INSTAGRAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
- Look at the browser console for detailed error messages
- The test button will show you exactly what's wrong

## 🔒 Security Note

- Never commit your access token to git
- For production, use environment variables
- Your token will expire - you may need to refresh it periodically
