        description: "We were fortunate to have Bhimesh intern with Nebullam during summer of 2017, as well as spring 2018. The major focus for Bhimesh was on creating our Android application for indoor farming partners, which needed to capture our real-time environmental data and present it in a clean and succinct way to each and every user. The user experience was very well received by our team and partners, and we have since modeled our other platform designs from that application. His critical thinking and developer skill set helped us to further improve efficiencies throughout Nebullam as a whole."
